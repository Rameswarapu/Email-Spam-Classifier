# Email-Spam-Classifier
Email classification is the process of categorizing incoming emails into different predefined classes or categories based on their content, context, or purpose. This classification is typically performed automatically using machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP) techniques, and other pattern recognition methods.

The main goal of email classification is to efficiently and accurately sort incoming emails, making it easier for users to manage and prioritize their inbox. By automatically classifying emails into specific categories, users can quickly identify and focus on the most important messages, reducing the time spent on sorting through irrelevant or spam emails.

Here are some common categories into which emails are often classified:

Inbox: This is the default category for most incoming emails that don't fit into any specific classification. These are typically regular emails from acquaintances, colleagues, or businesses that are not related to any particular topic.

Spam/Junk: These emails are unsolicited and typically sent in bulk. They often contain advertisements, phishing attempts, or other malicious content. Spam filters are used to automatically detect and move these emails to the spam folder.

Social/Notifications: Emails from social media platforms, online communities, and other websites that send notifications or updates fall into this category. Examples include Facebook notifications, LinkedIn messages, and Twitter alerts.

Promotions/Marketing: Emails related to marketing campaigns, promotions, discounts, or newsletters sent by businesses or organizations to their subscribers belong to this category.

Personal: This category includes emails from friends, family members, or close acquaintances. They are typically of a non-professional nature and might include personal conversations or updates.

Work/Professional: Emails related to work, job-related communication, official announcements, or business inquiries are classified under this category.

Important/Urgent: This category includes emails that are marked as urgent or flagged by the user as important. It helps users identify critical emails that require immediate attention.

Archived: Some email clients allow users to archive emails that they wish to keep for reference but don't require immediate attention. These emails are moved to the archive category.

Sent Items: This category includes copies of emails that the user has sent.

Drafts: Emails that are saved as drafts but not yet sent.

The classification process involves training machine learning models on labeled datasets, where emails are manually categorized by humans. The models learn from these examples and then apply the acquired knowledge to automatically classify new incoming emails into the appropriate categories.
